## Natural Language Processing Bootcamp

- Set up Spacy and Language Library
- Understand Basic NLP Topics:
  - Tokenization
  - Stemming
  - Lemmatization
  - Stop Words
- Spacy for Vocabulary Matching

### What is Spacy

- For many NLP tasks, Spacy only has one implemented method, choosing the most efficient algorithm currently available (often do not have the option to choose other algorithms)

### What is NLTK

- Natural Langugage Toolkit (very popular open source)
- Initially released in 2001 (older than Spacy which released 2015)
- Provides many functionalities, but includes less efficient implementations

### NLTK vs Spacy

|     Requirements      |            NLTK             |                                             Spacy                                             |
| :-------------------: | :-------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Many common NLP tasks |  Slower and less efficient  | Faster and more efficient (cost of user not being able to choose algorithmic implementations) |
|  Pre-created models   | Typically easier to perform |        Does not include pre-created models for some applications (sentiment analysis)         |

### What is NLP

- Natural Language Processing
- An area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data
- Often when performing analysis, lots of data is numerical (sales numbers, physical measurements, quantifiable categories)
- Computers are very good at handling direct numerical information
- As humans, we can tell there is a plethora of information inside of text documents but a computer needs specialized processing techniques in order to "understand" raw text data
- Text data is highly unstructured and can be in multiple languages
- NLP attempts to use a variety of techniques in order to create structure out of text data (basic techniques - built into libraries - Spacy, NLTK)
- Example Use Cases:
  - Classifying Emails (Spam vs Legitimate)
  - Sentiment Analysis of Text Movie Reviews
  - Analyzing Trends from written customer feedback forms
  - Understanding text commands (Google - "Hey Google, play this song")
